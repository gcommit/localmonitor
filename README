This little python script will measure your bandwidth. 
You can visualize it with gnuplot. 

You will need:
Python
Gnuplot
pip speedtest-cli 

Little HowTo:
*First Demo*
I created a bandwidthdata.csv with demo data. To visualize just run: 
gnuplot liveplot.gnu

To measure your own network, run "python3 monitor.py" - it will recreate the CSV file and fill it with your live data

Enjoy!
